# CoPilot Promot for working with Nuke Builds

### Nuke Build Project

The nuke build project is a c# project in the solution that uses the Nuke build system.  It will end with .build and be a standard csharp project.  If you are asked to work on a nuke build, you will be working in this project.


### Nuke Standard Steps

There are a set of standard steps that we prefer to have in the builds.  These steps can be found in the Templates folder in the _Dependencies project.  You should use these steps as the starting point for the builds
and if you are asked to compare with the standards steps you should ensure that each of the targets in the standard steps is present in the build project.
